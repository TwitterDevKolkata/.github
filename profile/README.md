## About 
**Twitter developer communities are for everyone interested in working with and learning about Twitter's developer products and APIs. We organize events which aim to bring developers, Twitter engineers, and various partners together for technical talks and networking.**
 
## Participating in the community 
We welcome pull requests that add meaningful additions to these code samples. We believe that a welcoming community is important and we ask that you follow Twitter's [Open Source Code of Conduct](https://github.com/twitter/.github/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) in all interactions with the community.
